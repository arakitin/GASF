    Every living body consists of cells. Cells of most of the organisms have a nucleus, where DNA's 
    (split into many chromosomes) are floating in a pool of cytoplasm. Some organisms have one set of 
    chromosomes (haploid), others - two sets of identical copies (diploid), some have three, four 
    and so on up to sixteen sets of copies.

    Humans are diploid and have 2n = 46 chromosomes, 
    22 pairs of autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes: XX for females, XY for males
    (see the picture to the left). The autosomal chromosomes within a pair are called <i>homologous</i>.
    If a person has an extra chromosome (i.e. one of the homologous pairs is, actually, a triad) it is called 
    <i>trisomy</i> on a given chromsome. If <b>every</b> homologous pair is tripled, it is called <i>triploidy</i>.<br>
    
    Each chromosome contains a long (a few meters) very densely packed in a double-helix shape strand of DNA. 
    This strand consists of hundreds of thousands proteine nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine,
    abbreviated A, T, C, and G) connected together with phosphates.

    The nucleotides within this strand couple to each other: A ↔ T and C ↔ G, as shown in the picture to the right.

    The DNA sequences of homologous chromosomes are usually not
    exactly identical.  They have the same nucleotides in about 99.5%
    of the loci. The remaining 0.5% are comprised of insertions,
    deletions, inversions, translocations and copy number differences
    of the human genome “master copy”.

    The most important of these
    variations is a single-base substitution called Single Nucleotide
    Polymorphism (SNP), pronounced <i>snip</i> (see the picture to the left).
    We refer to two possible nucleotides at SNP as two <i>alleles</i>.
