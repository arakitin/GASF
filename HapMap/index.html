    Every living body consists of cells. Cells of most of the organisms have a nucleus, where DNA's 
    (split into many chromosomes) are floating in a pool of cytoplasm. Some organisms have one set of 
    chromosomes (haploid), others - two sets of identical copies (diploid), some have three, four 
    and so on up to sixteen sets of copies. Humans are diploid and have 2n = 46 chromosomes, 
    22 pairs of autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes: XX for females, XY for males
    (see the picture to the left). The autosomal chromosomes within a pair are called <it>homologous</it>.

    Each chromosome contains a long (a few meters) very densely packed in a double-helix shape strand of DNA. 
    This strand consists of hundreds of thousands nucleotides (named A,T,C and G) connected together with 
    phosphates. The nucleotides within this strand couple to each other: A ↔ T and C ↔ G 
    The sequence of nucleotides in a given chromosome is almost the same between any two people 
    (about 99.5% of them are the same). The remaining 0.5% are comprised of insertions, deletions, 
    inversions, translocations and copy number differences of the human genome “master copy”. 
    The most important of these variations is a single-base substitution called 
    Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), pronounced <it>snip</it>. We refer to two possible 
    nucleotides at SNP as two <it>alleles</it>.
