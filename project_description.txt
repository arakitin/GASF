All living organisms consist of cells. All cells contain complete
information about all the organism's traits encoded in the DNA
molecules. These molecules are made of a few billions of nucleotides
of four different types (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine,
abbreviated A, T, C, and G) forming extremely long strands very
densely packed within chromosomes. Human cells have 22 pairs of
identical (within a pair) chromosomes and another pair of sex
chromosomes X and Y. The DNA sequences of different people differ
only by a fraction of a percent (something like 10 millions
nucleotides) and these variations determine variations between
people's traits. Relatively recently completed project called HapMap
provides those DNA sequences collected from 4 groups of people:

-- Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (abbreviation: YRI)
-- Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (abbreviation: JPT)
-- Han Chinese in Beijing, China (abbreviation: CHB)
-- CEPH (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) (abbreviation: CEU)

The data for all 23 pairs of the chromosomes for the people in 4 
groups above are publicly available at:
http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/genotypes/2006-01/non-redundant/

The detailed description of the data is located here:
http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/genotypes/2006-01/00README.txt

My goal is to determine for each DNA sequence what group out of 4
listed above it belongs to. Of course, the HapMap datasets already
have this information, so it will be a supervised learning problem.=
I am going to split the data into parts and use one part to train 
my classification algorithm and another part - to test it. The 
performance of the algorithm will be estimated by its 
misclassification rate (the smaller, the better).
